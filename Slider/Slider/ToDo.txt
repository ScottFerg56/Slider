* consider base class for Stepper & Camera classes
	change properties from enum to list/array/IEnumuerable of some struct type
* remove 'get' from camera properties we never get
	avoid them in RequestDeviceProp
* consider base class for all INotifyPropertyChange implementations
* consider Stepper as a generalized class
	with settings integrated
* consider replacing Homed with 'ready' status from device
	could incorporate multiple limit switches
* consider generalized Stepper Applets on device
* fix settings persistence lost with major change to Android
* TimeRemaining: consider single-phase solution of accelerating / decelerating only
* robustness during loss of connection
